title: Introduction

At 18F we use a variety of programming languages to accomplish our work. This
guide intends to help you setup each of these languages with the proper tools
in place, using an environment as close to our production systems as possible,
for a seamless work experience.

At the same time, most of the content is not 18F-specific. We hope developers
beyond 18F are able to use this guide as a starting point for establishing
their own standard environments.
